Building Cloud-connected Device Types
=====================================

Cloud-connected devices use a third-party service to accomplish device communication. 
An example of such a device is the
Ecobee thermostat.

When developing a device handler for a cloud connected device, you must create a service manager SmartApp that will handle authenticating with the 3rd party service, communicating with the device, and reacting to any device changes that occur.

This guide overviews the concept of the service manager/device handler architecture and
also gives an example of both the service manager and device handler creation.
