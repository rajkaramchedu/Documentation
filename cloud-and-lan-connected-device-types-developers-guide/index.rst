Cloud- and LAN-connected Devices
================================

Cloud- and LAN-connected devices are devices that use either a third-party service, like the Ecobee thermostat, or communicate over the LAN (local area network) like the Sonos system.
These devices require a unique implementation of their Device Handlers.
Cloud- and LAN-connected devices use a Service Manager SmartApp along with a Device Handler for authentication, maintaining connections, and device communications. 
This guide will walk you through Service Manager and Device Handler creation for both of these scenarios.
