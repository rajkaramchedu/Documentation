Writing Style Guide
===================

When you write for SmartThings platform, your audience should find your documentation readable, interesting and informative.
To accomplish these goals, we encourage you to stick to our recommended writing style.

----

Titles and headings
-------------------

Wherever possible, write purpose-driven documentation.
This means writing document titles and section headings that state the benefit explicitly.
Such titles or headings can be written as either calls to actions or tasks that can be done.
This approach makes it easier for the reader to learn how to get her job done.

**Examples:**

- Preferred: Writing Your First SmartApp (document title)
- Avoid: SmartApp Fundamentals (document title isn't purpose-driven)
- Preferred: Create your own RESTful API (section heading)
- Avoid: Parent-child SmartApps (document title isn't purpose-driven)
- Preferred: Combine Multiple Automations (document title)

.. note::

    - A **document title** is the main title of a document page. A document has only one document title. Example: "Writing Style Guide" at the beginning of this page. The document title also appears at the top level in the navigation bar, so it must be short, preferably four to five words or less.
    - A **section heading** is the title for an individual section within a document page. Example: "Titles and headings" at the top of this section. A document page can have multiple sections, and hence multiple section headings.

Avoid framing as questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Avoid using questions in document titles and section headings.

**Example:**

- Avoid: How does the switch turn on?
- Preferred: How the switch turns on (section heading)

Avoid italics (emphasis)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Avoid using emphasis (italics) in document titles or section headings.
See :ref:`page_structure`.

----

Document titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use title case, as in “Document Titles” and not “Document titles.”

**Example:**

- The title of this document, "Writing Style Guide."

What not to capitalize in title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- as (SmartApp as a Wakeup Device)
- to (How to Subscribe to Events)
- on (Trigger on Time)
- at (Alarm at a Specific Time)
- of, the (No More Rules of the Game)
- in (Your First SmartApp in Five Minutes)
- the (Motion at the Garage Door)
- a (Three Critical Triggers in a Day)
- for (Temperature Control for Basement)

What to capitalize in title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- is (Device Health Is Reported Weekly)
- was (Motion Was Detected)
- then (Set a Sunrise Automation, Then Sit Back)
- up (Biff Stood Up to Trigger the Alarm)
- that (The Battery That Lasts Forever)
- with (The Day Ends With Cheers All Around)

Section headings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use sentence case, as in “Subscription management,” and not the title case, as in “Subscription Management.”

.. note::

    - A **sentence case** is where you only capitalize the first letter of the sentence.
    - A **title case** is where you capitalize first letter of every word of the sentence.

----

.. _ui_elements:

UI elements
-----------

Always use italics emphasis when quoting a UI element label such as a button label or an icon label.

**Example:** 

    Go to the *Simulator* menu, and click on *Browse SmartApp Templates* in the dropdown list. 

Here it is in reStructuredText:

    Go to the \*Simulator* menu, and click on \*Browse SmartApp Templates* in the dropdown list.

----


.. _list_elements:

List elements
-------------

Always start a list segment with a heading and a colon.

**Example:**
    
    To publish a SmartApp or a Device Handler for yourself, follow these steps:

    - Make sure that you are in the proper Location.
    - From your SmartApp or Device Handler view, click on *Publish* button. Then click the *For Me* option. 

----

If it is a complete sentence, always end the list element, numbered or unordered, with a period. 

.. note::

    This applies also for a list element that has multiple sentences.

**Example:**

    To publish a SmartApp or a Device Handler for yourself, follow these steps:

    - Make sure that you are in the proper Location.
    - From your SmartApp or Device Handler view, click on Publish button. Then click the For Me option. 

----

If it is an incomplete sentence, do not end the list element with a period.

**Example:** 

    When you finish this tutorial, you will know: 

    - Key components of a SmartApp
    - Features of IDE
    - Controlling devices

----

Always write a list sentence in the sentence case.

**Example:** 

    - (YES) Make sure that you are in the proper Location.
    - (NO) Make Sure That You Are In the Proper Location.

----

Avoid more than two levels of lists.

**Example:** 

(YES) SmartThings platform supports various Hub scenarios such as: 

    - There may not be a hub at all
        - There may be a third-party Hub present
        - An all-cloud environment with no Hub whatsoever
    - SmartApps may run across both cloud and Hub connected devices
    - There may be multiple Hubs

(NO) SmartThings platform supports various Hub scenarios such as: 

    - There may not be a hub at all
        - There may be a third-party Hub present
            - Highlight supported third-party Hubs
    - An all-cloud environment with no Hub whatsoever
    - SmartApps may run across both cloud and Hub connected devices
    - There may be multiple Hubs

----

.. _page_structure:

Page structure
--------------

Each document should be named with a ``.rst`` file extension.
Each page is composed of a title, followed by some short text outlining the purpose of the document.

Sections should be delimited by ``----``, to insert a line separator.

The structure should look like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    ==========
    Page Title
    ==========

    Some introductory material.

    ----

    Section 1
    ---------

    Section text.

    ----

    Section 2
    ---------

    Section text.

    Subsection 2.1
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Subsection text.



Page title
^^^^^^^^^^

Page titles appear at the top of the document, and have a row of ``===`` characters above and below.
Page titles should have title capitalization:

.. code-block:: rst

    ====================
    This is a Page Title
    ====================

Headings
^^^^^^^^

Top-level section headings are followed by a row of ``---`` characters.
They should have sentence capitalization:

.. code-block:: rst

    This is a section
    -----------------

Subsection headings are followed by a row of ``^^`` characters.
They should have sentence capitalization.

.. code-block:: rst

    This is a section
    -----------------

    This is a subsection
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    Not all documents currently follow the guideline of using ``^^^`` for subsections.
    If you are editing a document and see a different heading syntax, feel free to change it.

----

reStructuredText syntax
-----------------------

Links
^^^^^

Links to external targets look like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    `SmartThings <http://smartthings.com>`_

Links to sections within the document can be included like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    Section name
    ------------

    See `Other section`_ for more information.

    Other section
    -------------

The ``:ref:`` target allows us to link to other documents or document sections.
It requires placing a label above a section, title, or image:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. _section_label:

    Some section
    ------------

Another document can then link to ``Some section`` like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    See :ref:`section_label` for more information.

Lists
^^^^^

Ordered lists appear like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    #. Item 1
    #. Item 2
    #. Item 3

Which results in:

#. Item 1
#. Item 2
#. Item 3

Unordered lists use a ``-`` or ``*`` character:

.. code-block:: rst

    - First bullet
    - Second bullet

Inline markup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Surround text with \* for *italics text*.
- Surround text with \** for **strong text**.
- Surround text with \`` for code samples (``someMethod()``).

When referring to method calls in the documentation, place ``()`` after the method name: ``methodName()``.
This helps distinguish methods from other code literals.

Code examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code blocks can be included using the ``code-block`` directive.
Use the appropriate language for the code sample.
Code blocks may appear with line numbers (use ``:linenos:``) and may emphasize certain lines:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. code-block:: groovy
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 3

        def someMethod() {
            def myVar = 14
            doSomethingAmazing(myVar)
        }

The above code block renders as:

.. code-block:: groovy
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    def someMethod() {
        def myVar = 14
        doSomethingAmazing(myVar)
    }

Images
^^^^^^

Images are found in the ``/img`` directory of the documentation, and can be included like this (you may need to alter the path depending on the location of the document):

.. code-block:: rst

    .. image:: ../img/getting-started/building-img.png

The above will render as:

.. image:: ../img/getting-started/building-img.png

Admonitions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Admonitions are ways of calling out certain bodies of text:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. note::

        A note provides more information about the content, in a side-bar like format.

    .. tip::

        A tip is some extra information that while not strictly necessary, may lead to the reader learning a new way of doing something.

    .. warning::

        A warning is just that - a warning of something that the reader should be aware of.

    .. error::

        An error is for error conditions.

The above results in:

.. note::

    A note provides more information about the content, in a side-bar like format.

.. tip::

    A tip is some extra information that while not strictly necessary, may lead to the reader learning a new way of doing something.

.. warning::

    A warning is just that - a warning of something that the reader should be aware of.

.. error::

    An error is for error conditions.


Tables
^^^^^^

Simple tables in RST look like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    ========= =========
    Heading 1 Heading 2
    ========= =========
    1.1       1.2
    2.1       2.2
    ========= =========

The above renders as:

========= =========
Heading 1 Heading 2
========= =========
1.1       1.2
2.1       2.2
========= =========

Grid tables can be written like this:

.. code-block:: rst

    +------------+------------+-----------+
    | Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3  |
    +============+============+===========+
    | body row 1 | column 2   | column 3  |
    +------------+------------+-----------+
    | body row 2 | Cells may span columns.|
    +------------+------------+-----------+
    | body row 3 | Cells may  | - Cells   |
    +------------+ span rows. | - contain |
    | body row 4 |            | - blocks. |
    +------------+------------+-----------+

Which results in:

+------------+------------+-----------+
| Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3  |
+============+============+===========+
| body row 1 | column 2   | column 3  |
+------------+------------+-----------+
| body row 2 | Cells may span columns.|
+------------+------------+-----------+
| body row 3 | Cells may  | - Cells   |
+------------+ span rows. | - contain |
| body row 4 |            | - blocks. |
+------------+------------+-----------+

----

API reference documents
-----------------------

The API reference documentation contains all public API method definitions.
API reference documentation is located in the ``ref-docs/`` directory.

Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^

API reference documents include an introduction and a listing of all APIs in alphabetical order.

.. note::

    The SmartApp and Device Handler API reference documentation lists all required callback methods to be listed first.
    The remaining APIs are then listed in alphabetical order.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each API reference document contains a brief overview of the API, along with a quick example of how to reference the object (if applicable).

Consider the example of the Device API reference documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

    ======
    Device
    ======

    The Device object represents a physical device in a SmartApp.
    When a user installs a SmartApp, they typically will select the devices to be used by the SmartApp.
    SmartApps can then interact with these Device objects to get device information, or send commands to the Device.

    Device objects cannot be instantiated, but are created by the SmartThings platform and available via the name given in the preferences definition of a SmartApp:

    .. code-block:: groovy

        preferences {
            section() {
                // prompt user to select a device that supports the switch capability.
                // assign the chosen device to a variable named "theswitch"
                input "theswitch", "capability.switch"
            }
        }
        ...
        // access Device instance using the input name:
        def deviceDisplayName = theswitch.displayName
        ...

Method documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Method documentation adheres to these rules:

- The method name is a first-level heading followed by an open and close parentheses (to denote it is a method, not a property).
- A brief description of the method follows the first-level heading.
- The method's signature, parameters, return type, any declared exceptions, and a brief example follows.

The example below illustrates this, and can be used as a template when writing API documentation.
Each component title (Signature, Parameters, etc.) of the API documentation is bolded, and the content follows on the next line, indented by one tab (or four spaces).
Details about each component follows.

.. code-block:: rst

    rgbToHex()
    ----------

    Converts an RGB value to a hexadecimal color string.

    **Signature:**
        ``static String rgbToHex(red, green, blue) throws IllegalArgumentException``

    **Parameters:**
        `Integer`_ red - The red value, between 0 and 255

        `Integer`_ green - The green value, between 0 and 255

        `Integer`_ blue - The blue value, between 0 and 255

    **Returns:**
        `String`_ - The hexadecimal representation of the RGB value

    **Throws:**
        `IllegalArgumentException`_ - An ``IllegalArgumentException`` is thrown if any of the RGB values are not within the 0 to 255 range.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: groovy

        def deepSkyBlueInHex = colorUtil.rgbToHex(0, 191, 255)
        log.debug "RGB 0,191,255 in Hex is $deepSkyBlueInHex"

Signature
`````````

The method signature is the same as the method's source definition, formatted as an inline code block.

Parameters
``````````

Method parameters are documented according to the following rules:

- Each parameter is listed, in order, with a link to the return type.
- All external links are defined at the bottom of the document.
- In cases of standard Java return types, a link to the Java 7 JavaDocs for the type is used. If the return type is a SmartThings object, a link to that SmartThings object reference document is used.
- If the method does not accept parameters, the entire parameters block is omitted.
- Optional parameters are placed inside square brackets.
- Parameters that accept a map include a table listing all the supported key/value pairs:

.. code-block:: rst

    **Signature:**
        ``List<Event> events([max: N])``

    **Parameters:**
        `Map`_ options *(optional)* - Options for the query. Supported options:

        ======= ========== ===========
        option  Type       Description
        ======= ========== ===========
        ``max`` `Number`_  The maximum number of Events to return. By default, the maximum is 10.
        ======= ========== ===========


Returns
```````

Method return values are documented according to the following rules:

-  The return statement begins with a link to the return type (external or internal), along with a brief description of the value returned.
- In the case of ``void`` return types, do not include the "Returns" component.

For example:

.. code-block:: rst

    **Returns:**
        `String`_ - The hexadecimal representation of the RGB value



Throws
``````

Methods that throw an exception as part of their contract include a "Throws" component, with a link to the exception type, and when the exception is thrown:

.. code-block:: rst

    **Throws:**
        `IllegalArgumentException`_ - An ``IllegalArgumentException`` is thrown if any of the RGB values are not within the 0 to 255 range.

Example
```````

Most methods include an example of their usage.
The example code should include the minimum amount of code to highlight the documented method.

Some simple methods may not require an example--use your judgement.

Miscellaneous tips
------------------

- Spell check before committing.
- Show, don't tell - include example code.
- Place each sentence on a new line to help with review and readability.
- Not all documents currently follow these guidelines. See the `Contributing <https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/Documentation/blob/master/README.md>`_ guide to learn how you can contribute, and help address that. :)
